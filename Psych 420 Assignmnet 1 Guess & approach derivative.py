def newtonsmethod (function, derivativefunction, guess, threshold, iteration):

    #function represents the formula used (numrator)
    #derivative function represents the derivative of the function (denominator)
    #guess is the users initial guess
    #threshold represents the amount that the initial guess can approach before the program stops







#some things that I tried towards making the code was trying the following:
    #using an eval function, however, that is bad coding practice
    #using a def f(x): return (x**3) - this works && yields the same results as
    #using f = lambda x: x**3 i still don't know the instance why you would use one
    #over the other
