#notes| things to work on still
#create a function that helps the voltage amount decrease exponentially until
#it reaches the resting potential, 0
#create a method that increases the spike of the voltage from 3 to 8
#create a method that decreases the voltage when it hits 8 to 0
#set an if statement and a check statement to have the voltage increase from 0 to 3
    #the check statement will be that when time == stop_time: break
#create a graph that shows the voltage increase from every cycle
